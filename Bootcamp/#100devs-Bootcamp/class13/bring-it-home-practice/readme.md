# Bring it home assignment for class 14
As i was looking at the javascript assignement for the class, i found i more interesting in my case to 
play around it to learn a little bit more.

The application get the variable needed to create the function for the task.
Instead of writing them in the code, we ask the user to give us the variable and 
the code for the  function will be written for the user in the test area.

A button is present to reload the app and one to copy the solution.
