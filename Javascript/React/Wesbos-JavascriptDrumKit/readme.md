## My way to learning React.
A small project based on Wes Bos's Javascript Drum Kit at https://javascript30.com

It's an attempt for me to use some new learning skill with React17.
I've struggling for 4 hours to try to make it works and didn't find why
it was failing. After some time, find information the with React17, 
we need to use UseEffect to add some event in the dom at start.
Hope it will be useful to someone.

Css/Images/sound must be taken from https://javascript30.com website and,
at that time, why not follow these course on the website, they're free to take.
