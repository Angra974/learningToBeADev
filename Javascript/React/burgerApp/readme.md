## My way to learning React.
A small project taken from https://www.akashmittal.com/reactjs-sample-project-step-by-step/

All documentation and step are on akashmittal.com.

Here is only my code while following the step, with some little change.

My setup:     
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
